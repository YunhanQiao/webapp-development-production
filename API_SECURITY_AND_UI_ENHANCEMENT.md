# API Security & UI Enhancement Update

## Summary of Changes

This update includes two main improvements:

### 1. Security Enhancement: Google Places API Key Protection
- **Issue**: Google Places API key was hardcoded in `public/index.html`
- **Solution**: Moved to environment variable pattern for better security
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced hardcoded key with `%REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY%` in `public/index.html`
  - Added `.env.example` file with placeholder values for new developers
  - Updated `.gitignore` to include `.env.local` for additional security

### 2. UI Enhancement: Timestamp Entry Method Disabled
- **Issue**: Timestamp hole finish entry method was available but not fully implemented
- **Solution**: Disabled the feature with clear "Coming soon!" messaging
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `ScoreControlsBar.jsx` to always disable "timestamps" option
  - Updated display text to "Hole finish timestamps (Coming soon!)"
  - Simplified logic by removing conditional disabling for this specific feature

## Technical Details

### Environment Variable Setup
The Google Places API key is now handled securely:
- Development: Add `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=your_key` to `.env` file
- Production: Set environment variable in deployment environment
- Create React App automatically replaces `%REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY%` during build

### Time Entry Method Controls
The tournament scoring interface now clearly communicates that timestamp entry is a future feature:
- Dropdown option is grayed out and disabled
- Clear messaging about availability
- Maintains UI consistency for when feature is ready

## Files Modified
- `public/index.html` - Secured Google Places API key
- `src/features/competition/pages/scores/ScoreControlsBar.jsx` - Disabled timestamp entry
- `.gitignore` - Added `.env.local` protection
- `.env.example` - Added template for environment variables

## Benefits
- ✅ **Security**: API keys no longer exposed in source code
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear communication about unavailable features  
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Easy environment setup with `.env.example`
- ✅ **Future-Ready**: Simple to enable timestamp feature when implementation is complete
