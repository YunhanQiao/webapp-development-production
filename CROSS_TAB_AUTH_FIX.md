# Cross-Tab Authentication Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
The cross-tab authentication synchronization was causing infinite loops when users logged out:

1. Tab A logs out → clears localStorage (email-based key)
2. Tab B detects change → calls `logoutUser()`
3. Tab B's logout clears localStorage again
4. Tab A detects this → calls `logoutUser()` again
5. Loop continues indefinitely...

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Logout Signal
- Removed `auth-logout-signal` from the detection logic
- This signal was causing recursive logout calls

### 2. Added Anti-Recursion Guards
- Added `window.isProcessingCrossTabLogout` flag to prevent multiple logout calls
- Added `window.isProcessingCrossTabLogin` flag to prevent multiple login calls
- Flags auto-reset after 1 second

### 3. Enhanced Login Sync Logic
- Added better validation for token existence
- Improved condition checking for when to sync

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useCrossTabAuthSync.js`

## Benefits
✅ **Eliminates infinite loops** - No more recursive authentication calls
✅ **Maintains cross-tab sync** - Tabs still sync login/logout properly  
✅ **Better performance** - Reduces unnecessary Redux dispatches
✅ **Improved reliability** - More robust error handling

## Testing
1. Open multiple tabs
2. Log in on one tab → other tabs should sync login
3. Log out on one tab → other tabs should sync logout
4. No infinite loops should occur

## Time to Implement
- **5 minutes** to analyze and fix
- **Quick win** solution that doesn't require backend changes

## Next Steps
For enhanced security, consider:
- Moving to HTTP-only cookies (requires backend coordination)
- Implementing sessionStorage instead of localStorage
- Adding proper CSRF protection
